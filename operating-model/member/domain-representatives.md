# Domain Representatives

## Context

We have twelve development teams that are providers or consumers of data.
The teams are supposed to engage in governance.
If each team sent a representative to the governance group,
the group would be too large.
Each team belongs to a scaled group of teams (e. g. domain or tribe)

## Decision

Each domain will send one representative who acts on behalf of the domain.

## Consequences

- The governance group stays smaler
- Representative have to consolidate informations and opinions
- Major decisions might need a feedback cycle in each domain
- Prepared decisions will be published beforehand
