# Single representative with local data guilds

## Context

With over 20 development teams it's not possbile to represent each team.
Even the amount of higher groupings (domains, tribes) is too hight.
Even representatives of those groups will lead to inefficient communication.

## Decision

Development teams will be represented by a single person.
The teams will organize local groups (guilds, chapters) to consolidate knowledge and requirements.

## Consequences

- A person which enough time to act as a serveant leader between the governance group and the teams
- A way to consolidate knowledge and requirements between the teams (e. g. via chapters or guilds)
- Higher risk to build an "ivory tower"
- Regulary surveys and discoveries about the experience and adoption in the development teams
