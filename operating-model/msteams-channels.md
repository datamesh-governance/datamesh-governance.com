# Slack Channels

## Context

The federated governance group needs to communicate with the rest of the organisation, and vice versa.

We primarily use MS Teams, and every domain team has their own *team* in MS Teams.

## Decision

We use a *Data Mesh* team in MS Teams to collaborate across the organisation. In this team, we use the following three MS Teams channels:

### `Governance`

The team API for the federated governance group.

- In this channel, anybody can ask questions, bring topics or concerns.
- In this channel, the group announces news and important decisions. 
- In this channel, facilitators announce upcoming meeting dates with agenda for interested stakeholders to join.
- Members: All users of the data mesh platform

### `Governance (internal)`
- In this channel, the members of the Federated Governance Group discuss, communicate, and work together.
- Members: Federated Governance Group

### `Governance Updates`
- In this channel, updates on new or changed global policies and their adoption status are published.
- Use comments in threads to discuss changes.
- Members: Domain Teams

## Consequences
- Simple communication
- Uncluttered

## Automation
- Integration with Confluence to post updates on page changes to `Governance Updates` automatically
