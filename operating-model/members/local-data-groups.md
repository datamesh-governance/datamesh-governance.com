# Local Data Groups

## Context

With over 20 domain teams it's not possible to represent all teams in the governance group.

## Decision

Teams organize local data groups (guilds, chapters) to consolidate knowledge, issues, and requirements.

A local data group nominates a representative to join the governance group.

## Consequences

- A person to act as a liaison between the governance group and the local data groups
- The requirements of teams are consolidated
- Local data groups are a way for more informal exchange
- Higher risk to build an "ivory tower"
