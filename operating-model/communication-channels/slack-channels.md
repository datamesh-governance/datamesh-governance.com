# Slack Channels

## Context

The federated governance group needs to communicate with the rest of the organisation, and vice versa.

## Decision

We use the following three Slack channels for the communication between our federated governance group and the rest of the organisation. 

### `#datamesh-governance`

The team API for the federated governance group.

- In this channel, anybody can ask questions, bring topics or concerns.
- In this channel, the group announces news and important decisions. 
- In this channel, facilitators announce upcoming meeting dates with agenda for interested stakeholders to join.
- Audience: All users of the data mesh platform

### `#datamesh-governance-internal`
- In this channel, the members of the Federated Governance Group discuss, communicate, and work together.
- Audience: Federated Governance Group

### `#datamesh-governance-updates`
- In this channel, updates on new or changed global policies and their adoption status are published.
- Use comments in threads to discuss changes.
- Audience: Domain Teams

## Consequences
- Simple communication
- Uncluttered

## Automation
- Integration with Confluence to post updates on page changes to `#datamesh-governance-updates` automatically
