# Regular Governance Meetings

How are the policies created, reviewed, discussed, and agreed upon?

## Decision

We meet every two weeks online.

In the meeting, we work on the policies together, and we decide upon them.

We use the following agenda as a template for every meeting.

### Meeting Agenda

1. Welcome
  - Show usage metrics as key result
  - Celebrate new usages of data products
2. Evaluate
  - Discuss accepted policies, based on feedback
  - Track platform implementation of accepted policies
  - Track team adoption of accepted policies
3. Elaborate
  - Work together to formulate policies
  - Discuss options
4. Decide
  - Agree on proposed policies
5. Closing
  - Feedback

## Consequences

- Synchronous way of working requires similar timezones of the governance group members
- Allows only a limited number of people in the meeting to be effective
