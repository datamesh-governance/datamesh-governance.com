# Regular Governance Meetings

How are the policies created, reviewed, discussed, and agreed upon?

## Decision

We meet every two weeks online.

In the meeting, we work on the policies together, and we decide upon them.

We use the following agenda as a template for every meeting.

### Meeting Agenda

Welcome
- Show usage metrics as key result
- Celebrate new usages of data products

Evaluate
- Discuss accepted policies, based on feedback
- Track platform implementation of accepted policies
- Track team adoption of accepted policies

Elaborate
- Work together to formulate policies
- Discuss options

Decide
- Agree on proposed policies

## Consequences

- Synchronous way of working requires similar timezones of the governance group members
- Allows only a limited number of people in the meeting to be effective
