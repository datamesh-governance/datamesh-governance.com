# ISO 8601 Strings

Category: Interoperability

## Context

Many datasets contain date and timestamp values.
Some file formats (such as JSON, CSV) have no native representation for date or timestamps.

## Decision

We will use ISO 8601 representation for date and timestamps and save them as String fields. Timestamps may include up tp microsecond precision. Timestamps include the offset or `Z` for UTC. Technical timestamps should be stored in UTC time.

Example date: `"2022-12-31"`

Example timestamp: `"2023-01-03T20:43:18+02:00"`

Example timestamp: `"2023-01-03T18:43:18.123456Z"`

## Consequences

- Most programming languages and frameworks support conversion of ISO 8601 dates and times to native representations.
- Timestamps are human-readable without conversion.
- Actual zone (such as PST or CEST) is not stored
- Sortable (if all are in same timezone)
