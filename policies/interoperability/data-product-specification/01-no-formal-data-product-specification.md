# No Formal Data Product Specification

Category: Interoperability

## Context

How do we specify the syntax and semantics of data products in a standardized way?

## Decision

We don't use a formal specification for data products.

We will reevaluate in one year if a standard has emerged that provides significant benefits.

## Consequences

- No need to curate a data product specification.
- We continue to publish data products in our data catalog 
- No disadvantages, as currently no available specification has any significant tool support.
