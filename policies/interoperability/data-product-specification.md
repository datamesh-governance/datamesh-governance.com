# Data Product Specification

Category: Interoperability

## Context

How do we specify the syntax and semantics of data products in a standardized way?

## Decision

We don't use a formal specification for data products.

We will reevaluate in one year if a standard has emerged that provides significant benefits.

## Consequences

- No need to curate a data product specification.
- We continue to publish data products in our data catalog 
- No disadvantages, as currently no available specification has any significant tool support.

## Considered Alternatives
 
- Do nothing
- [Open Data Product Specification](http://opendataproducts.org)
- [Agile Lab Data Product Specification](https://github.com/agile-lab-dev/Data-Product-Specification)
- [Data Product Descriptor Specification](https://dpds.opendatamesh.org/resources/specifications/1.0.0-DRAFT/)
